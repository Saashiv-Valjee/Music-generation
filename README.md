# Music-generation
Store my attempts at using NLP to generate music

LSTM file is a previous attempt that I ran out of time to finish, it was able to generate music but not to a satisfying quality. MusicNLP was a time constrained recent attempt. While both are able to generate music, good music is subjective and requires human intervention to succesfully generate. I'd enjoy experimenting with the training data, expeically with regard to controlling the key & variance of the note characteristics to more closely examine what the model is learning.
